What is a Loop and Switch Case in JavaScript define that ?

=> A condition statement, also known as a conditional statement, is a programming construct that allows a program to make decisions and execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. In JavaScript, the primary condition statements are if, else if, else, and switch.

=> if Statement:

The if statement evaluates a condition (an expression that returns true or false).

If the condition evaluates to true, the block of code within the if statement is executed.

If the condition evaluates to false, the code block is skipped.

Example:
            let age = 20;

            if (age >= 18) {
            console.log("You are an adult.");
            }

=> else Statement:

The else statement follows an if statement.

The block of code within the else statement is executed if the if statement's condition evaluates to false.

Example:
            let age = 15;

            if (age >= 18) {
                console.log("You are an adult.");
            } else {
                console.log("You are a minor.");
            }

=> else if Statement:

The else if statement allows you to add additional conditions after an if statement.

You can use multiple else if statements to check multiple conditions in sequence.

The block of code within the first true else if condition is executed, and the rest are skipped.

Example:
            let score = 75;

            if (score >= 90) {
                console.log("Grade: A");
            } else if (score >= 80) {
                console.log("Grade: B");
            } else if (score >= 70) {
                console.log("Grade: C");
            } else {
                console.log("Grade: D");
            }

=> switch Statement:

The switch statement evaluates an expression and executes code blocks based on the result.

It matches the value of the expression against a series of case labels.

If a matching case is found, the associated block of code is executed.

A default case can be included to handle situations when no case matches.

Example:
            let fruit = "apple";

            switch (fruit) {
                case "apple":
                console.log("You chose an apple.");
                break;
            case "banana":
                console.log("You chose a banana.");
                break;
            case "orange":
                console.log("You chose an orange.");
                break;
            default:
                console.log("Unknown fruit.");
            }
