What is the difference between && and || in JavaScript? 

Logical AND (&&)                                                             Logical OR (||)

Operator: &&                                                                   Operator: ||               

Behavior: The && operator evaluates to true if                      Behavior: The || operator evaluates to

Example 1:                                                          Example 1:

console.log(true && true); // Outputs: true                         console.log(true || true);
console.log(true && false); // Outputs: false                       console.log(true || false);
console.log(false && true); // Outputs: false                       console.log(false || true);
console.log(false && false); // Outputs: false                      console.log(false || false);

Example 2:                                                          Example 2:

let age = 25;                                                       let color = "red";
if (age >= 18 && age <= 65) {                                       if (color === "red" || color === "blue") {
    console.log("You are eligible to work.");                           console.log("You chose red or blue.");
} else {                                                            } else {
