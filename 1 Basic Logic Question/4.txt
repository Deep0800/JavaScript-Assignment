Write a mul Function Which will Work Properly When invoked With Following Syntax.

=> To create a mul function in JavaScript that works properly with a specific syntax, such as a function that can chain calls to multiply multiple numbers, you can use a function that returns another function. This way, you can chain calls to multiply additional numbers.

=> Here is an example of a mul function that achieves this behavior:

function mul(a) {
    function multiply(b) {
        a *= b; // Multiply the current product with the new number
        return multiply;
    }
    
    // Add a `toString` method to handle the final conversion to a number
    multiply.toString = function() {
        return a;
    };
    
    return multiply;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(mul(2)(3)(4).toString());
