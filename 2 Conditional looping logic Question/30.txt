What are the looping structures in JavaScript? Any one Example?

=> for Loop:

The for loop is a common loop structure that consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.

The loop executes as long as the condition is true.

Example:
            for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                console.log(i);   
            }

=> while Loop:

The while loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

The condition is checked before each iteration of the loop.

Example:
            let i = 0;
            while (i < 5) {
                console.log(i);
                i++;
            }
=> do...while Loop:

The do...while loop is similar to the while loop, but it ensures that the loop body is executed at least once, even if the condition is false at the start.

Example:
            let i = 0;
            do {
                console.log(i);
                i++;
            } while (i < 5);

=> for...in Loop:

The for...in loop iterates over the enumerable properties (keys) of an object.

Example:
            const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
            for (const key in obj) {
                console.log(`${key}: ${obj[key]}`);
            }

=> for...of Loop:

The for...of loop iterates over iterable objects such as arrays, strings, and other collections.

It provides an easy way to iterate over the values of an iterable.

Example:
            const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
            for (const value of array) {
                console.log(value); // Outputs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
            }
