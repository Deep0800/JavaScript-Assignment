=>Arrays:

Ordered Collection:
Arrays are ordered collections of values, where each value is identified by an index starting from 0.
They maintain the order of elements, meaning that the sequence in which elements are added to the array is preserved.

Homogeneous Data:
Arrays are typically used to store homogeneous data types, such as numbers, strings, or objects of the same type.
However, JavaScript arrays can also contain mixed data types, including other arrays and objects.

Methods and Properties:
Arrays come with built-in methods and properties for manipulating and accessing their elements, such as push(), pop(), splice(), concat(), length, etc.
These methods make it easy to add, remove, or modify elements in the array.

Use Cases:
Arrays are commonly used to store lists of items, such as a list of names, numbers, or objects.
They are useful for operations like iteration, sorting, filtering, and mapping over elements.

=>Objects:

Key-Value Pairs:
Objects are collections of key-value pairs, where each key is a unique string (or symbol) and each value is associated with a key.
Unlike arrays, objects do not have an inherent order, and the order of properties may not be preserved.

Heterogeneous Data:
Objects can store heterogeneous data types, including primitive values (e.g., strings, numbers, booleans) and complex types (e.g., arrays, other objects, functions).
They are particularly useful for representing entities with properties and behaviors.

Properties and Methods:
Objects can have properties (keys) and methods (functions) associated with them, which allow for encapsulation of data and behavior.
Properties can be accessed and modified using dot notation (object.property) or bracket notation (object['property']).

Use Cases:
Objects are often used to represent entities, such as user profiles, products, or configuration settings.
They are suitable for modeling complex data structures and organizing related data and behavior.
